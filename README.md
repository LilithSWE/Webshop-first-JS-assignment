# Amanda's Amigurumi Webshop

This project was my first JS school assignment! I was tasked to create a one-pager webshop following certain requirements. Using pictures taken by myself of my crochet hobby projects I created Amanda's Amigurumi Webshop!

## Lessons Learned

- I learned how to make use of tools like Miro to set up the structure of the website in an easy to read way.
- I learned how to write basic JS. How to make functions, call functions, create variables ect.
- How to adapt the functions so that they are as versitile as possible, to avoid retyping parts of the code.
